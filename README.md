# spring-boot-journal-2
This is another Spring Boot Journal, this time testing out REST API's with using just Curl

The actual design of the webpage is credited to Felipe Gutierrez, author of Pro Spring Boot. There are some differences between the text and the actual code here.
Special attention should be given to the application.properties file, as there is an additional line needed for making Spring Boot 2.x.x allow construction of tables and adding those things to a database that is NOT memory-based (i.e. using MySQL versus H2).
